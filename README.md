[Video of gripper!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DQgi8Ua-VAU)

**MSG compliant AI stepper gripper** is a gripper based on [StepFOC stepper drivers](https://source-robotics.com/products/spectral-micro-bldc-controller). It is a gripper capable of controlling its gripping force (We use FOC control on steppers :D), making it perfect for assembly tasks and human-robot collaboration AND AI training application because of its designed with cameras in mind! This gripper is modular in nature in 2 ways:
* Adjust grip length with different linear rails with options of 100mm,150mm and 200mm.
* Adjust grip strength with different stepper sizes, supporting steppers of lenght 21.5mm, 40mm and 60mm

Force can be adjusted from 5 N to 80 N allowing you to grasp a wide range of items; from delicate and soft to rigid and sturdy. 

Mechanical files and firmware are open source allowing you to add a custom griping tool and attach it to any robotic arm or robot. Gripper software is also open-source.

# How to build / Where to buy?

You can buy MSG gripper on our website: https://source-robotics.com/products/compliant-gripper

If you want to Source all the parts yourself and build your own follow these steps:

* Source all the parts from the [BOM](https://github.com/PCrnjak/SSG-48-adaptive-electric-gripper/tree/main/BOM)
* Follow [Assembly instructions](https://github.com/PCrnjak/SSG-48-adaptive-electric-gripper/tree/main/Assembly%20manual) or [Video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=127zXHKuqIg) to assemble your gripper
* Follow [DOCS](https://source-robotics.github.io/SSG48-gripper-docs/page1_about_the_gripper/) to get your gripper up and running.
